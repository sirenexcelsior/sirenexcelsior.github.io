Hi, I am a student studying Artificial Neural Networks in the [Chair of Mathematical Theory of Intelligent Systems](http://intsys.msu.ru) at [the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics](https://math.msu.ru), Moscow State University and my science advisor is [Prof. Dr. Sc. Chasovskikh](http://intsys.msu.ru/staff/chasovskikh/). Currently I am working on a task related to "geometric deep learning" and "protein surface binding site identification".
