Hi, I am a Ph.D student studying Artificial Neural Networks in the [Chair of Mathematical Theory of Intelligent Systems](http://intsys.msu.ru) at [the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics](https://math.msu.ru), Moscow State University and my science advisor is [Prof. Dr. Sc. Vadim](http://intsys.msu.ru/staff/kozlov/) and [Ass.Prof. Dr. Alekseev](http://intsys.msu.ru/staff/alexeev/). Currently I am working on a task related to "Geometric deep learning" and "Equivariant Neural Networks".
