  title={Fast end-to-end learning on protein surfaces},
  author={Sverrisson, Freyr and Feydy, Jean and Correia, Bruno E and Bronstein, Michael M},
  abstract={In this paper, we present a new framework for deep learning on protein structures that addresses these limita- tions. Among the key advantages of our method are the com- putation and sampling of the molecular surface on-the-fly from the underlying atomic point cloud and a novel efficient geometric convolutional layer. As a result, we are able to process large collections of proteins in an end-to-end fash- ion, taking as the sole input the raw 3D coordinates and chemical types of their atoms, eliminating the need for any hand-crafted pre-computed features.},

  title={Geodesic convolutional neural networks on riemannian manifolds},
  author={Masci, Jonathan and Boscaini, Davide and Bronstein, Michael and Vandergheynst, Pierre},
  abstract={Feature descriptors play a crucial role in a wide range of geometry analysis and processing applications, including shape correspondence, retrieval, and segmentation. In this paper, we introduce Geodesic Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN), a generalization of the convolutional networks (CNN) paradigm to non-Euclidean manifolds. Our construction is based on a local geodesic system of polar coordinates to extract "patches", which are then passed through a cascade of filters and linear and non-linear operators. The coefficients of the filters and linear combination weights are optimization variables that are learned to minimize a task-specific cost function. We use GCNN to learn invariant shape features, allowing to achieve state-of-the-art performance in problems such as shape description, retrieval, and correspondence.},
