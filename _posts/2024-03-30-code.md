This is a site for the record of all test answers for the course [Assembly Language](https://scs.math.msu.ru/node/4281 ), Spring 2024, taught by Леонов Александр Георгиевич, on the online course platform [mirera.ru](https://mirera.ru/user/groups/65cb80e98cd5ad641f4efb8b).



## Lecture 01

### 0 (Example)

```assembly
MOV AX,0	; Move 0 to register AX, i.e., assign the value
```

### 2000

Write a program that puts 2000 in the AX register.

```assembly
MOV AX, 2000
```

### Data

Write a program that puts data from BX in the AX register.

```assembly
MOV AX, BX
```

### Sum (Example)

Run the program that puts the sum of data from BX and CX into the AX register.

```assembly
MOV AX,BX
ADD AX,CX
```

### Subtract
Write a program that places the result of subtracting data CX from BX into register AX.

```assembly
SUB BX, CX
MOV AX, BX
```

### Calculate

Write a program that places the result of operation into register AX.

```assembly
MOV AX, 0
MOV BX, FF00
MOV CX, F
MOV DX, F1

AND CX, DX
OR  CX, 80

MOV AX, BX
OR  AX, C0
ADD AX, CX
NEG AX
```
