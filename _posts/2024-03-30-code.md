This is a site for the record of all test answers for the course [Assembly Language](https://scs.math.msu.ru/node/4281 ), Spring 2024, taught by Леонов Александр Георгиевич, on the online course platform [mirera.ru](https://mirera.ru/user/groups/65cb80e98cd5ad641f4efb8b).

You can see some of the points about the classroom in "[Some points about Assembly Language 2024](https://sirenexcelsior.github.io/blog/2024/as-point/)".



## Lecture 01

### 0 (Example)

```assembly
MOV AX,0	; Move 0 to register AX, i.e., assign the value
```

### 2000

Write a program that puts 2000 in the AX register.

```assembly
MOV AX, 2000
```

### Data

Write a program that puts data from BX in the AX register.

```assembly
MOV AX, BX
```

### Sum (Example)

Run the program that puts the sum of data from BX and CX into the AX register.

```assembly
MOV AX,BX
ADD AX,CX
```

### Subtract
Write a program that places the result of subtracting data CX from BX into register AX.

```assembly
SUB BX, CX
MOV AX, BX
```

### Calculate

Write a program that places the result of operation into register AX.

```assembly
MOV AX, 0
MOV BX, FF00
MOV CX, F
MOV DX, F1

AND CX, DX
OR  CX, 80

MOV AX, BX
OR  AX, C0
ADD AX, CX
NEG AX
```

### Swap

Write a program that swaps two numbers in registers BX and CX.

```assembly
MOV AX, BX
MOV BX, CX
MOV CX, AX
```

### Swap Return

Write a program that swaps two numbers in registers BX and CX (Not use Push/Pop or other registers)!

```assembly
ADD BX, CX
SUB CX, BX
NEG CX
SUB BX, CX
```

### NOT

Bitwise Unary NOT (~) performs *complementation* or *negation* operation; inverts all the bits of the number, i.e. *0→1* and *1→0*.

- Truth table:

  | **A** | **~ A** |
  | :---: | :-----: |
  |   0   |    1    |
  |   1   |    0    |

Write a program that places the result of operation NOT into register AX. (Not use Push/Pop or other registers)!

```assembly
NEG AX
DEC AX
```

### Remember!

Write a program that stores two numbers in registers BX and CX between operations.

```assembly
PUSH BX
PUSH CX

MOV DX,0
MOV CX,0
MOV BX,0
MOV AX,0

POP CX
POP BX
```

### XOR

Exclusive or or exclusive disjunction is a logical operation that is true if and only if its arguments differ (one is 1, the other is 0).
Exclusive disjunction is often used for bitwise operations. Examples:

- 1 XOR 1 = 0
- 1 XOR 0 = 1
- 0 XOR 1 = 1
- 0 XOR 0 = 0

Write a program that places the result of operation AX XOR BX into register AX. (Not use Push/Pop or all other registers, you can use only one extra register - CX)!

```assembly
MOV CX, AX
OR  AX, BX
AND BX, CX
NEG BX
DEC BX
AND AX, BX
```

### Left Shift (Example)

Run the program that multiply by 2 a number in the AX register.

*Do Not forget CLC before any RCL!* 

```assembly
CLC
RCL AX
END
```

### Right Shift

Write a program that divides by 2 the number in register CX and puts the result in register AX.

*Do Not forget CLC before any RCR!* 

```assembly
CLC
RCR CX
MOV AX, CX
```

### MultiShift

Write a program that puts the value of AX multiplied by 4 into register BX and the value of AX divided by 4 into register CX.

Use the shift operations RCL and RCR.

*Do Not forget CLC before any RCL and RCR!* 

```assembly
MOV BX, AX
MOV CX, AX

CLC
RCL BX
CLC
RCL BX

CLC
RCR CX
CLC
RCR CX
```

### Sum

Write a program that puts into register AX the sum of two 8-bit numbers stored in 16-bit register BX.

Example: BX = $$ 032E_{16} $$, result AX = $$ 03_{16} + 2E_{16}$$ = $$31_{16} $$.



If BX=0, then AX=0.

Use the shift operations RCL or RCR.

*Do Not forget CLC before any RCL and RCR!* 

```assembly
MOV AX, BX
AND AX, 00FF
MOV CX, BX

CLC
RCR CX
CLC

### Bit number

Bits in a 16-bit register are numbered from 1 (least significant bit) to 16. Write a program that finds the least significant non-zero bit number of register BX and puts the answer into register AX.

If BX=0, then AX=0.

Use the RCR shift operation.

Example: BX=$$0006_{16}$$ (0000 0000 0000 01102), AX=2.

 RCL shift operations are used.

```assembly
CLC
RCL AX
RCL BX
```

### Long shift to the right

### Bus for programmers

Bus tickets for programmers have a hexadecimal number. We call a ticket lucky if the sum of the two left hexadecimal digits is equal to the sum of the two right digits, for example ADE9. Example of an unsuccessful ticket: 7+8≠9+3. How many lucky ticket numbers are found from number BX to number CX, including borders?

```assembly
; Code to achieve the task goal: to determine whether a number is a lucky vote or not
; Method: Read four 4-bit binary numbers in sequence using 0 and 1 operations, and then use RCR to transfer the data to the real data.
; Then, judge whether the final result is 0 by adding and subtracting to determine whether it is a lucky number of votes.

Example: BX=$$100_{16}$$ ⇒ AX=$$300_{16}$$

```assembly
ADD BX, 200
MOV AX, BX
```

```assembly
?00:
CMP CX, 0
JZ  ?01

ADD AX, [BX]
DEC CX
INC BX
JMP ?00

?01:
```

### Equal array

Write a program that puts 1 in register AX if all elements of an array of length CX are equal. The array starts at address BX. The answer is 1 if the array has length 0.

```assembly
MOV AX ,  1
MOV DX ,  [BX]

CMP CX ,  0
JZ  ?02
CMP CX ,  1
JZ  ?02

DEC CX
?00: 
CMP CX ,  0
JZ  ?02

INC BX
DEC CX

CMP DX ,  [BX]
JNZ ?01
JMP ?00

?01: 
MOV AX ,  0

?02: 
```

### Address of the first minimum number

Write a program that places the address of the first minimum number in an array of length CX into register AX, starting at address BX.

In the case of an empty sequence, the answer is 0.

```assembly
MOV AX, 0
CMP CX, 0
JZ  ?02

In the case of an empty sequence, the answer is 0.

Example: 1 2 3 2 3 1 ⇒ AX=3.

```assembly
MOV AX ,  0

JZ  ?02

MOV AX , 1
MOV DX ,  [BX]
INC BX

?00: 
DEC CX
CMP CX ,  0

MOV DX ,  [BX]
INC BX
JMP ?00

?01: 
INC AX
MOV DX ,  [BX]
INC BX
JMP ?00

?02:
```

### Address of the second maximum

The CX register contains a value - the number of elements of the sequence located starting from the address BX.

In the case of an empty sequence, the answer is 0

If there is no second maximum, the answer is 0.

Example: 1 2 3 2 3 1 ⇒ AX=5.

```assembly
MOV AX ,  0
MOV [01F8] , 0			; A null address is needed for data transit in this task, and a random address is chosen here, but this is not a good method.
MOV DX ,  [BX]
ADD CX ,  2

```

### Number of local maxima of the sequence

Write a program, after the execution of which, the register AX will contain the number of local maxima of the sequence.

The CX register contains a value - the number of elements of the sequence located starting from the address BX.

In the case of an empty sequence, the answer is 0.

An element of a non-empty sequence is called a local maximum if it has no neighbor greater than itself. For example, a sequence of one element has one local maximum. The sequence 4, 4, 2, 3, 0 has three local maxima: the first, second, and penultimate elements.

```assembly
; 
```

### The lengths of the sides form a parallelogram

The array contains the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram as it is traversed clockwise.

Write a program that puts 1 in register AX if the elements of the array (lengths of sides) of size CX, starting at address BX, form a parallelogram, and zero otherwise.

In case of error data (CX≠4) the answer is 0.

```assembly

CMP [BX] ,  DX
JNZ ?00

ADD BX , 1
