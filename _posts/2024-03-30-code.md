This is a site for the record of all test answers for the course [Assembly Language](https://scs.math.msu.ru/node/4281 ), Spring 2024, taught by Леонов Александр Георгиевич, on the online course platform [mirera.ru](https://mirera.ru/user/groups/65cb80e98cd5ad641f4efb8b).



## Lecture 01 - Intro. Registers.

### 0 (Example)

```assembly
MOV AX,0	; Move 0 to register AX, i.e., assign the value
```

### 2000

Write a program that puts 2000 in the AX register.

```assembly
MOV AX, 2000
```

### Data

Write a program that puts data from BX in the AX register.

```assembly
MOV AX, BX
```

### Sum (Example)

Run the program that puts the sum of data from BX and CX into the AX register.

```assembly
MOV AX,BX
ADD AX,CX
```

### Subtract
Write a program that places the result of subtracting data CX from BX into register AX.

```assembly
SUB BX, CX
MOV AX, BX
```

### Calculate

Write a program that places the result of operation into register AX.

```assembly
MOV AX, 0
MOV BX, FF00
MOV CX, F
MOV DX, F1

AND CX, DX
OR  CX, 80

MOV AX, BX
OR  AX, C0
ADD AX, CX
NEG AX
```

### Swap

Write a program that swaps two numbers in registers BX and CX.

```assembly
MOV AX, BX
MOV BX, CX
MOV CX, AX
```

### Swap Return

Write a program that swaps two numbers in registers BX and CX (Not use Push/Pop or other registers)!

```assembly
ADD BX, CX
SUB CX, BX
NEG CX
SUB BX, CX
```

### NOT

Bitwise Unary NOT (~) performs *complementation* or *negation* operation; inverts all the bits of the number, i.e. *0→1* and *1→0*.

- Truth table:

  | **A** | **~ A** |
  | :---: | :-----: |
  |   0   |    1    |
  |   1   |    0    |

Write a program that places the result of operation NOT into register AX. (Not use Push/Pop or other registers)!

```assembly
NEG AX
DEC AX
```

### Remember!

Write a program that stores two numbers in registers BX and CX between operations.

```assembly
PUSH BX
PUSH CX

MOV DX,0
MOV CX,0
MOV BX,0
MOV AX,0

POP CX
POP BX
```

### XOR

Exclusive or or exclusive disjunction is a logical operation that is true if and only if its arguments differ (one is 1, the other is 0).
Exclusive disjunction is often used for bitwise operations. Examples:

- 1 XOR 1 = 0
- 1 XOR 0 = 1
- 0 XOR 1 = 1
- 0 XOR 0 = 0

Write a program that places the result of operation AX XOR BX into register AX. (Not use Push/Pop or all other registers, you can use only one extra register - CX)!

```assembly
MOV CX, AX
OR  AX, BX
AND BX, CX
NEG BX
DEC BX
AND AX, BX
```

### Left Shift (Example)

Run the program that multiply by 2 a number in the AX register.

*Do Not forget CLC before any RCL!* 

```assembly
CLC
RCL AX
END
```

### Right Shift

Write a program that divides by 2 the number in register CX and puts the result in register AX.

*Do Not forget CLC before any RCR!* 

```assembly
CLC
RCR CX
MOV AX, CX
```

### MultiShift

Write a program that puts the value of AX multiplied by 4 into register BX and the value of AX divided by 4 into register CX.

Use the shift operations RCL and RCR.

*Do Not forget CLC before any RCL and RCR!* 

```assembly
MOV BX, AX
MOV CX, AX

CLC
RCL BX
CLC
RCL BX

CLC
RCR CX
CLC
RCR CX
```

### Sum

Write a program that puts into register AX the sum of two 8-bit numbers stored in 16-bit register BX.

Example: $$ BX = 032E_{16} $$, result $$ AX = 03_{16} + 2E16 = 31_{16} $$.



If BX=0, then AX=0.

Use the shift operations RCL or RCR.

*Do Not forget CLC before any RCL and RCR!* 

```assembly
MOV AX, BX
AND AX, 00FF
MOV CX, BX

CLC
RCR CX
CLC
RCR CX
CLC
RCR CX
CLC
RCR CX
CLC
RCR CX
CLC
RCR CX
CLC
RCR CX
CLC
RCR CX

ADD AX, CX

END
```

## Lecture 02 - Jump and Call

### Zero Comparison (Example)

Run a program that compares BX and CX and sets AX=1 when BX = CX

```assembly
CMP BX,CX
JNZ ?1
MOV AX,1
?1:
```

### Comparing two numbers

Write a program that puts 1 in register AX if BX $$\ge$$ CX and 0 otherwise.

```assembly
CMP BX, CX
JC  ?01
MOV AX, 1
JMP ?02
?01:
MOV AX, 0
?02:
```

### Absolute value

Write a program to put the absolute value of the difference between the numbers in BX and CX into register AX.

```assembly
CMP BX, CX
JNC ?01
SUB CX, BX
MOV AX, CX
JMP ?02
?01:
SUB BX, CX
MOV AX, BX
?02:
```

## Lecture 03 - Addressing modes

### Contents of an Address

Write a program that puts the contents at address BX into register AX.

```assembly
MOV AX, [BX]
```
